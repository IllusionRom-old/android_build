 +Illusion Source
 +===================
 +
 +Getting Started
 +---------------
 +To get started with Illusion-Dev sources, you'll need to get
 +familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/version-control.html).
 +
 +
 +Create the Directories
 +----------------------
 +
 +You will need to set up some directories in your build environment.
 +
 +To create them run:
 +
 +    mkdir -p ~/bin
 +    mkdir -p ~/illusion
 +
 +
 +Install the Repository
 +----------------------
 +
 +Enter the following to download make executable the "repo" binary:
 +
 +    curl https://dl-ssl.google.com/dl/googlesource/git-repo/repo > ~/bin/repo
 +
 +    chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
 +
 +You may need to reboot for these changes to take effect. 
 +Now enter the following to initialize the repository:
 +
 +    cd ~/illusion
 +
 +
 +Repositories:
 +---------------
 +
 +Before you continue --> run this in the terminal
 +----------------------------------------
 +   repo init -u git://github.com/IllusionRom/platform_manifest.git -b 4.4
 +
 +*PLEASE NOTE THAT YOU MUST USE THE -f flag when repo syncing/initializing if you want to sync with our default -j4 setup as android.googlesource seems to like to reject your requests if you set your -jflag too high. 
 +if you wish to avoid this issue run it repo sync -j1 otherwise -f (force) is reccomended so it will resync the repos it gets error codes on. Thank you and have a nice day.*
 +
 +
 +Building the System
 +---------------
 +
 +Initialize the environment with the envsetup.sh script. Note that replacing "source" with a single dot saves a few characters, and the short form is more commonly used in documentation.
 +
 +
 +Build script
 +-------------
 +
 +. build/compile.sh
 +
 +
 +Manual commands
 +---------------
 +
 +
 +    . build/envsetup.sh
 +    lunch
 +
 +
 +Enter the number of the build you want to start and press enter
 +In our Rom you have to write *lunch ukg_maguro-userdebug* (without *) to build for example maguro.
 +
 +
 +Build the Code:
 +
 +make illusion zip -jx (x stands for jobs)
 +
